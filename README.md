# 🧠 Neural Network Project: Financial Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a project focused on developing and applying a **Neural Network (NN)** model to analyze financial data, likely for prediction or classification tasks. The primary dataset appears to be stock-related information (`dividendinfo.csv`).

The project includes the model training and evaluation script within a Jupyter Notebook, along with several generated outputs such as visualizations of the network architecture and performance graphs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project and reproduce the neural network analysis locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need **Python 3.x** and a set of libraries commonly used for machine learning and data handling.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/doublehm/Neural-Network-Project.git
    cd Neural-Network-Project
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project requires machine learning, data science, and visualization libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and potentially Graphviz for network visualization).

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy jupyter matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow # or pytorch
    ```

3.  **Run the analysis:**
    Launch the Jupyter Notebook environment:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    Open the file **`Neural network.ipynb`** and execute the cells sequentially to run the model, train the network, and regenerate all output files and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is built upon core Python tools for deep learning and data science:

  * **Jupyter Notebook**: For reproducible research and documentation of the machine learning workflow.
  * **Python**: The primary programming language.
  * **Deep Learning Framework**: **TensorFlow** Used for building and training the multi-layered neural network.
  * **Pandas/NumPy**: For data loading, preprocessing, and numerical operations.
  * **Matplotlib**: Used to generate the performance and results visualizations (`output*.png`).
  * **Graphviz**: (If used to generate the network visualization) Used for generating the `network.gv.pdf`.
